# INTRODUCTION
This is a dummy dataset that imitates the characteristics of data collected from hospital patients during covid-19 pandemic.

*Discalimer*: The dataset used for this analysis is a dummy dataset.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
This dataset comprises twenty-one columns, encompassing the input column that encapsulates information regarding the severity of COVID for specific individuals. The aim of this project is to build a ML model and train the model with the available features to predict the severity of Covid in individuals. The scale of severity in individuals ranges from
Level 1: Lowest level of covid detected (asymptotic)
Level 2: Mild symptoms*
Level 3: Moderate symptoms* 
Level 4: Moderate to severe symptoms* 
Level 5: Severe symptoms* 
Level 6: Critical symptoms
Level 7: Life threatening conditions
